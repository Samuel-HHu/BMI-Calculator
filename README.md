I am a college student who started working part-time after entering college. Initially, I would spend the money I earned from work on things that I liked, but later on, I realized that as an adult, I needed to develop a habit of saving money. 

So, I began researching bank fixed deposits and some compound interest savings plans. Eventually, I decided to use compound interest as one of my saving methods, and thus developed this system to help me easily and quickly calculate the compound interest results for different interest rates and years.

`Hope I can save more money!!!`
